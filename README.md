# TFG-Diabetes-Detection
Public repository of my final degree project

Natural order of the code:

* data_exploration.ipynb
* data_cleaning.ipynb
* training_and_test.ipynb
* further_improvement.ipynb
* further_improvement_XX_YY_ZZ.ipynb
* artificial_neural_network_YY_ZZ.ipynb

`further_improvement_XX_YY_ZZ.ipynb` and `artificial_neural_network_YY_ZZ.ipynb` code has been purposely reused in order to facilitate experimentation and the possibility of running each case separately.

Thank you very much for your time!
